    "- This assignment accounts for 20% of the marks for this course.\n",
    "- It is marked based on the PDF export from a Jupyter notebook (see __General instructions__ below), which you are to submit via Gradescope (see __Assessment/Assignment Submission/Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn).\n",
    "- The assignment is marked out of 100 and the number of points is indicated by each question. \n",
    "- We will assess your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "  - functional code that performs the computations asked for, as measured by verifying some of the numeric outputs from your processing and reading your code if there is doubt about what you have done\n",
    "  - the quality of the visualisations, measured against the _Visualisation principles and guidance_ handout in the S1 Week 5 workshop (PDF available in S1 Week 4 folder in Learn)\n",
    "  - the quality of your textual comments - as measured by how accurate, complete and insightful they are.\n",
    " \n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions carefully, answering what is required and only that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill in your answers in the cells indicated. You may delete text like \"Your answer to Q1.2 goes here\". __Do not edit or delete any other cells.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep your answers brief and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving visualisations, make sure to label them clearly and provide legends where necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving numerical values, use correct units where appropriate and format floating point values to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished a question, use a Jupyter notebook server to export your PDF, by selecting __File->Download as->PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check this PDF document looks as you expect it to. If changes are needed, update the notebook and export again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished all the questions, submit the final PDF using the submission instructions in the __Assessment->Assignment Submission->Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn. __Please allow enough time to upload your PDF before the deadline.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## How long should I spend on this coursework?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have designed the coursework to take around 8 hours for a student who has completed the lab sessions, attended the lectures and workshops and done the comprehension questions. There will be some spread around this value, but if you're up-to-date with the course, and you're taking much longer than 8 hours (say 12 hours), then you might want to consider how many marks you are gaining for each extra hour of work."

Additional data on six other measures (GDP per capita, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and corruption) are used to explain how much these factors increase happiness above Dystopia. Dystopia is a hypothetical country with values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.  The [FAQ section of the World Happiness Report website](https://worldhappiness.report/faq/) has more information about the methodology.\n",

The questions are organised so that the first few questions give more detailed instructions and the later questions are more open-ended. We also want you to consider whether there are any limitations of the data that should be considered. Finally, the datasets used in this notebook are not large enough to cause issues, but do consider computational complexity and efficiency of your code."
